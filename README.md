# Crimson Mother-game
Files for the game project I'm working on using Unreal, Maya, and Blueprint.  
This Repo is to keep track of the game's progress and development.

# Description ( main idea )
In "Crimson Mother," you awaken to a realm cloaked in silence, the ground beneath you blanketed in pristine snow, painting a serene yet eerie landscape.  
  
Your memory is a blur, and the reason for your presence in this forest is unknown, instinctual urge propels you forward: to explore the land, unravel its mysteries, and survive.  
  
As you venture deeper into the forest, it becomes clear that this is no ordinary wilderness. The snow seems to whisper secrets of ancient rites and rituals, leading you to the realization that you must gather sacred objects scattered across the land. These artifacts are the keys to appeasing the Crimson Mother, a mythical entity that reigns over the forest. Only by offering these artifacts as a sacrifice at her altar can you hope to earn your passage back to the realm of the living. Along the way, you will see multiple ongoing rituals by the Scarlet Servants. They will also be scattered around the map, protecting said artifacts. Always be aware of the Mother's "disciple" who is obsessed with collecting "Bloodoath Strayers" to treat as her torturing toys.  
  
Moreover, scattered throughout the forest are remnants of those who came before you, offering clues to the lore of the land and the origin of the Crimson Mother. These tales provide a deeper understanding of the world and its inhabitants. Which helps you remember the reason you were sent into this realm.
